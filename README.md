## Go Experiments

This repository contains a collection of Go experiments. The experiments are, essentially, a collection of small programs that I wrote to learn about Go. The notes were done using external references and ChatGPT explanations.

Some of the contents were introduced by Ot√°vio Augusto Gallego, FIAP alumni.

1. [Hello World](hello-world/hello-world.go)
